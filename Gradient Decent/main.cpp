/*
Next steps for openCL:
Split device mesh into 2 sub classes (DeviceMeshCUDA DeviceMeshCL)
Save for gradient
make a factory
have optimzer call the facotry which switches what kind of DMesh and Grandients it hands out. 
So we have
[x] Figue out make file
[x] Figure out #ifdef USE_BUILD_X
[x] Split mesh
[x] split Grandiet
[ ] rewrite kernals
[x] make Factory
[x] hook up facotry to Optimzier*/
